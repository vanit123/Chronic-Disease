              <b><u><p style="font-family: cursive;">precautions taken Before affecting with diabetes:</p></b></u>
                <p style="color: brown;"><b>1.Lose extra weight:</p></b>
                
                <p >The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of their body weight to prevent disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater benefits</p>
                <p>Set a weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.</p>
            
                <p style="color: darkmagenta;"><b>2. Be more physically active:</p></b>

                <p>There are many benefits to regular physical activity. Exercise can help you:
                    • Lose weight
                    • Lower your blood sugar
                    • Boost your sensitivity to insulin — which helps keep your blood sugar within a normal range
                    Goals for most adults to promote weight loss and maintain a healthy weight include:
                
                    • Aerobic exercise. Aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise — such as brisk walking, swimming, biking or running — on most days for a total of at least 150 minutes a week.
                    • Resistance exercise. Resistance exercise — at least 2 to 3 times a week — increases your strength, balance and ability to maintain an active life. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics.
                    • Limited inactivity. Breaking up long bouts of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.</p>
                
                <p style="color: indianred;"><b>3. Eat healthy plant foods:</p></b>
                
                <p>Plants provide vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates in your diet. Carbohydrates include sugars and starches — the energy sources for your body — and fiber. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, is the part of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb.</p>
                <p>Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. Eat a variety of healthy, fiber-rich foods, which include:</p>
                <p> • Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees
                    • Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower
                    • Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils
                    • Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa</p>
                <p>The benefits of fiber include:
                    • Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels
                    • Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol
                    • Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation
                    • Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich
                Avoid foods that are "bad carbohydrates" — high in sugar with little fiber or nutrients: white bread and pastries, pasta from white flour, fruit juices, and processed foods with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
            <p style="color: darkviolet;"><b>4. Eat healthy fats:</p></b>

            <p>-->Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."</p>

            <p style="font-family: cursive;"><b><u>Precautions to be taken after Diabetes is attacked:</p></b></u>

              <p style="color:rgb(209, 0, 21);"><b>1. Make a commitment to managing your diabetes:</p></b>

              <p>Members of your diabetes care team — primary care provider, diabetes care and education specialist, and dietitian, for example — can help you learn the basics of diabetes care and offer support along the way. But it's up to you to manage your condition.</p>

              <p>Learn all you can about diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Maintain a healthy weight.

                Monitor your blood sugar, and follow your health care provider's instructions for managing your blood sugar level. Take your medications as directed by your health care provider. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.</p>
              <p style="color: deeppink;"><b>2. Don't smoke
                Avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke:</p></b><p> Smoking increases your risk of type 2 diabetes and the risk of various diabetes complications, including:
               • Reduced blood flow in the legs and feet, which can lead to infections, nonhealing ulcers and possible amputation
                    • Worse blood sugar control
                    • Heart disease
                    • Stroke
                    • Eye disease, which can lead to blindness
                    • Nerve damage
                    • Kidney disease
                    • Premature death
                
                Talk to your health care provider about ways to help you stop smoking or using other types of tobacco.</p>
               <p style="color: crimson;"><b>3. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control:</p></b>
                <p>Like diabetes, high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels. High cholesterol is a concern, too, since the resulting damage is often worse and more rapid when you have diabetes. When these conditions team up, they can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other life-threatening conditions.
                
                Eating a healthy, reduced-fat and low salt diet, avoiding excess alcohol, and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Your health care provider may also recommend taking prescription medication, if necessary.</p>
                <p style="color: chocolate;"><b>4. Schedule regular physicals and eye exams:</p></b>
                <p>Schedule two to four diabetes checkups a year, in addition to your yearly physical and routine eye exams.
                During the physical, your health care provider will ask about your nutrition and activity level and look for any diabetes-related complications — including signs of kidney damage, nerve damage and heart disease — as well as screen for other medical problems. He or she will also examine your feet for any issues that may need treatment.
                
                Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma.</p>

                 <b><u><p style="font-family: cursive;">precautions taken Before affecting with Cancer:</p></b></u>
                 <p><strong style="color: darkmagenta;">1.Don't use tobacco:</strong>Smoking has been linked to many types of cancer, including cancer of the lung, mouth, 
                 throat, voice box, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Even being around secondhand smoke might increase the risk of lung cancer.</p>
                 <p><strong style="color:rgb(65, 26, 155);">2.Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active:</strong>
                    Being at a healthy weight might lower the risk of some types of cancer. These include cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon and kidney.</p>
                <p><strong style="color: brown;" >3.Avoid risky behaviors:</strong>Another effective cancer prevention tactic is to avoid risky behaviors that can lead to infections that, in turn,
                   might increase the risk of cancer.such asPractice safe sex,Don't share needles</p>
                <b><u><p style="font-family: cursive;">precautions to be taken after Cancer is attacked:</p></b></u> 
                <p ><strong style="color: coral;">1. Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and getting enough rest can help support your overall well-being and 
                    may improve your body's ability to cope with cancer and its treatments.</p>
                <p><strong style="color: crimson;">2.Emotional Support:</strong> A cancer diagnosis can be emotionally challenging. Consider seeking support from counselors, therapists, 
                      support groups, or friends and family to help you cope with the emotional impact</p>
                <p><strong style="color: lightseagreen;">3.Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol:</strong> If you smoke, consider quitting, as smoking can exacerbate the risks associated with cancer. Additionally, 
                      limit alcohol consumption, as excessive alcohol can also increase cancer risks.</p>
                <p><strong style="color: firebrick;">4.Regular Screening:</strong> For some cancer types, regular screening may be important for early detection and prevention. Discuss screening recommendations with your healthcare provider.</p>

                <b><u><p style="font-family: cursive;">precautions taken Before affecting with Arthritis:</p></b></u>
                <p><strong style="color: blueviolet;"> 1.Maintain a Healthy Weight:</strong> Excess body weight can put extra stress on your joints, particularly in the knees, hips, and spine. Losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight can 
                  reduce the risk of developing arthritis and help manage symptoms if you already have it.</p>
                <p><strong style="color: coral;">2.Stay Hydrated:</strong> Proper hydration helps keep joint tissues lubricated and functioning optimally. Drink an adequate amount of water daily.</p>
